A 66-year-old patient, previously treated one year ago for rectal adenocarcinoma with abdominoperineal amputation, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, was admitted with bilateral ureterohydronephrosis due to post-radiation retroperitoneal fibrosis, accompanied by renal failure with a creatinine level of 370 mmol/L. Placement of standard double-J stents only resulted in transient improvement in renal function, followed by worsening two weeks later. However, the placement of tailed double-J stents led to regression of dilation and stabilization of renal function at a level of 180 mmol/L during 5 months of follow-up.
