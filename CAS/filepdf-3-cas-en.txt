A 45-year-old female patient with no significant medical history presented with symptoms of left-sided lower back pain, tinnitus, palpitations, headaches, and increased sweating after each urination, without urinary disorders or hematuria. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg at rest, which increased to 170/100 mmHg immediately after urination. The rest of the somatic examination was normal. Intravenous urography (IVU) showed a rounded, well-defined, 2 cm-sized lacunar image at the vesical dome (Figure 1). Transabdominal ultrasound revealed a solid mass protruding into the lumen, measuring 1.5 cm in diameter.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a well-defined, rounded lesion measuring 17 mm in diameter, without signs of extravesical extension. Additional sections of the adrenal glands confirmed their integrity (Figure 2).

Sagittal section in T1-weighted imaging, the tumor has intermediate signal.

The diagnosis of vesical pheochromocytoma was suspected, although urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were normal and catecholamine levels were not measured.

Fundus examination revealed narrowed arteries associated with poorly tolerated hypertension, as well as hypertensive chorioretinopathy scarring due to acute hypertensive episodes. Cystoscopy showed a single, approximately 15 mm in diameter tumor at the base of the bladder, round and hypervascularized, located 3 cm behind the interureteric ridge, covered by macroscopically normal mucosa. The patient underwent a midline laparotomy. Following longitudinal cystotomy and tumor localization, the base was clamped 0.5 cm away from the tumor, which was then resected using an electric knife. There was no elevation in blood pressure during the mobilization and resection of the tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful.

The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen, cut in two, revealed two distinct small oval formations with a fawn color, composed of cells with finely granular basophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei with fine chromatin and nucleoli, and well-defined cytoplasmic boundaries. The tumor elements were arranged in trabecular, cord-like, and alveolar structures within an endocrine-rich stromal type containing sinusoidal capillaries.

The postoperative course was favorable, with a follow-up period of 28 months. The patient is currently asymptomatic, with normal blood pressure and a normal follow-up IVU.
