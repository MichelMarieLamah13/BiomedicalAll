A 32-year-old patient with a history of polydrug abuse (cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, and cannabis) and chronic alcoholism is admitted to the emergency department due to clinical symptoms that appeared within the previous three days: restlessness, auditory and visual hallucinations, incoherent speech, loss of appetite, insomnia, and moderate headaches. Hemodynamically, the heart rate is 84 bpm, blood pressure is 114/91 mmHg, and the ECG is normal. The physical examination is unremarkable except for dilated pupils. The initial laboratory findings show CPK at 535 IU/L, hemoglobin level at 17.0 g/dL, normal lactate levels at 0.7 mmol/L, as well as normal blood gas values (pH 7.41, pCO2 40 mmHg, pO2 73 mmHg). The patient explains that he ingested 250 mg of desoxypipradrol purchased online. Due to the patient's agitation in the context of concurrent alcohol withdrawal, sedation with oxazepam was necessary. On day 5 after ingestion, the patient was calmer, still complained of some headaches, and had no hallucinations or fever. By day 7, all symptoms had disappeared.

Blood samples collected in EDTAK2 tubes on admission (day 3) and the second day of hospitalization (day 4), as well as a urine sample obtained on day 4, were analyzed using different techniques. Two high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods with UV detection (HP 1100, Agilent, Les Ulis, France) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (HP6890/HP5973N, Agilent, Les Ulis, France) were routinely used for a broad and qualitative drug screening. Additionally, two other methods, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) (Quattro Premier, Waters, Guyancourt, France) and HPLC-UV detection (HP 1200, Agilent, Les Ulis, France), were employed for quantitative analysis. Desoxypipradrol or 2-DPMP (C18 H21 N, molecular weight = 251.3 g/mol) was obtained as a hydrochloride form (LGC Standard, Molsheim, France).

Qualitatively, the HPLC-UV detection analysis revealed a single peak with two maxima at 225 and 260 nm and a retention time of 7.49 min (Figure 2). This spectrum showed >99% similarity to the spectrum of desoxypipradrol tested under the same conditions.

The GC-MS analysis performed on the urine sample demonstrated the presence of a peak with a retention time of 8.7 min, and its spectrum also showed similarity to 2-DPMP (Figure 3). Three major ions with m/z values of 250.2 (molecular ion M+), 165.1, and 84.2 were observed. The α-β bond breakage of nitrogen leads to the formation of diphenylmethane ion (m/z 165) and pipedrinium ion (m/z 81) (Figures 4, 5) [6].

Figure 6 presents the chromatograms obtained using UHPLC-MS/MS for plasma and urine samples for the selected transitions. The MS spectrum showed a major peak at m/z 252, which fragmented into two major daughter ions at m/z 91 and 167 with a collision energy of 25 eV (Figure 7).

The desoxypipradrol quantification method using UHPLC-MS/MS was validated with linearity (r2 > 0.998), repeatability (CV < 4.5%), intermediate precision (CV < 10%), and accuracy (CV < 15%) meeting the acceptability criteria. The limit of quantification was set at 10 μg/L (coefficient of variation below 20%).

Both quantitative techniques yielded similar results (difference less than 3%). The plasma concentration of desoxypipradrol was 136 μg/L on admission on day 3 after ingestion and 93 μg/L on day 4 (Table II). The urine concentration was 4,805 μg/L on day 4.
