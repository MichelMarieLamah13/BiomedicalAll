This is a 32-year-old Ghanaian woman who is 14 weeks pregnant. She has been experiencing vomiting since the beginning of her pregnancy, which has worsened over the three days prior to her hospitalization.

This is her second pregnancy. She already has a child who was born at 36 weeks of gestation with intrauterine growth restriction, without any other congenital abnormalities. The patient does not smoke, does not consume alcohol, and has no known drug allergies. Her medical history includes probable gestational diabetes and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) during her first pregnancy. During that time, she was hospitalized and received intravenous treatment with metoclopramide and diphenhydramine, followed by oral metoclopramide and hydroxyzine. Metoclopramide had to be discontinued due to an extrapyramidal reaction (jaw rigidity and difficulty speaking), and hydroxyzine was subsequently replaced with the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine (DiclectinMD).

During her first prenatal visit at 11 weeks of her second pregnancy, the patient had been experiencing nausea and vomiting for about ten days. Continuous intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline solution with 5% dextrose was administered to rehydrate her. She was discharged with a prescription for doxylamine and pyridoxine (six tablets per day). One week later, the patient presented to the emergency department with a recurrence of nausea, averaging four episodes of vomiting per day. Although she was able to eat and drink and her urinary ketones were negative, a diagnosis of erosive gastritis required the addition of oral ranitidine (150 mg twice a day) and alginate acid (after each meal and at bedtime).

Upon admission, the patient, at 14 weeks of pregnancy, experiences up to five or six episodes of vomiting per day and is unable to eat or drink. She presents the following symptoms: deterioration of general condition, hypersalivation, hematemesis, headaches, intestinal gas, and diffuse abdominal pain with epigastric tenderness increasing in intensity during vomiting. Obstetrically, the patient has no vaginal bleeding, no fluid leakage, and no uterine contractions. Her vital signs are normal. Since the start of her pregnancy, the patient has lost 16 kg, which corresponds to approximately 22% of her pre-pregnancy weight. Urine analysis shows the presence of ketones. Table I presents detailed laboratory test results and vital signs.

Upon admission, the patient is taking the following medications: 150 mg of oral ranitidine once a day, one prenatal multivitamin once a day, and eight tablets per day of doxylamine and pyridoxine. The emergency physician diagnoses hyperemesis gravidarum and erosive gastritis. The initial management of the patient includes hospitalization, initiation of the hyperemesis gravidarum treatment protocol at CHU Sainte-Justine (Figure 1), as well as liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound. No screening for Helicobacter pylori is performed. The patient receives hydration intravenously and the following medications intravenously: thiamine, diphenhydramine, continuous infusion of metoclopramide, pyridoxine, ranitidine, and multivitamins. Table II presents the evolution of the patient's medication during her hospitalization.

On day two, due to the patient's worsening condition during the night despite the initial medical treatment, intravenous ondansetron therapy is initiated at a dose of 4 mg every eight hours. The infusion of metoclopramide, increased in the morning to 65 mg per day, is finally discontinued due to the patient's history

 of extrapyramidal reaction during her previous pregnancy. Intravenous hydration, administration of diphenhydramine, pyridoxine, and multivitamins are continued. Since the relief of epigastric pain remains minimal, ranitidine is replaced with intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg once a day, with a rapid optimization to 40 mg intravenously every 12 hours. Abdominal ultrasound reveals no abnormalities.

On the morning of day three, due to the persistence of nausea, vomiting, and hypersalivation, the treatment team increases ondansetron to 8 mg intravenously every eight hours. Since the frequency of vomiting is still high and the patient has significant hypersalivation, the treatment team initiates oral clonidine at a dose of 0.05 mg twice a day. Intravenous hydration, administration of diphenhydramine, pantoprazole, pyridoxine, and multivitamins are continued. A decrease in epigastric pain is noted.

On day four, the patient's clinical condition improves. She experienced only nausea during the night and no vomiting. Since the patient's blood pressure remains acceptable (91-106/53-59 mm Hg), the clonidine dose is increased to the target dose of 0.1 mg twice a day. After 24 hours without vomiting, liquid nutrition is initiated. Epigastric pain shows favorable improvement. The patient continues to receive ondansetron, intravenous hydration, pantoprazole, diphenhydramine, pyridoxine, and multivitamins.

On day five, the patient tolerates a low-fat solid diet well. Nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, and heartburn have disappeared. While still on clonidine, the patient begins oral ondansetron as a maintenance treatment. Oral ranitidine (150 mg twice a day) replaces pantoprazole. Intravenous hydration, pyridoxine, and multivitamins are discontinued. Hydroxyzine (25 mg orally four times a day) replaces intravenous diphenhydramine.

On day six, the patient is discharged from the hospital as she tolerates solid food. Upon discharge, she is prescribed the following medications orally: omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, ondansetron 8 mg three times a day, clonidine 0.1 mg twice a day, and hydroxyzine 25 mg four times a day as needed.

Hospital pharmacists provided telephone follow-up with the patient every two to three weeks to reassess the treatment. Nine days after discharge, the patient was doing well and still taking ondansetron (8 mg three times a day), clonidine (0.1 mg twice a day), omeprazole (20 mg once a day), and hydroxyzine (25 mg at bedtime). Twenty-three days after discharge, the ondansetron dose was reduced to once a day, and omeprazole was discontinued. During this follow-up, a reduction in the clonidine dose was discussed. Two weeks later, the patient had indeed reduced her dose to 0.1 mg once a day, and she was still taking ondansetron (8 mg once a day). The patient ultimately continued and tolerated the use of clonidine (0.1 mg once a day), ondansetron (8 mg once a day), and hydroxyzine (25 mg once a day) throughout her pregnancy until delivery at 38 weeks. She gave birth to a healthy full-term baby girl weighing 2,950 g.
