Background

This is the case of a young Caucasian man who was diagnosed at the age of 12 with stage IV desmoplastic tumor and lung metastases. At the time of diagnosis, the mass was compressing the right kidney and causing severe hydronephrosis. The patient received five cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide). After tumor resection surgery, a cycle of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine) was administered in combination with abdominal radiotherapy. Eight months after the initial diagnosis, the patient underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for consolidation with conditioning using etoposide, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide due to the unfavorable prognosis of the disease. These treatments controlled the disease but resulted in moderate and later end-stage chronic renal failure. Hemodialysis sessions were initiated four and a half years after the cancer diagnosis, twice a week.

Five years after the autologous transplantation, at the age of 17, the patient was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome based on a bone marrow biopsy. A non-related cord blood allogeneic transplantation was performed after reduced-intensity conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit antithymocyte globulin. The transplantation procedure went without any particular incident, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 34 days after the transplantation, but continued to undergo dialysis at home two to three times a week.

Described Episode

Five months after the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the patient presented to the emergency department with facial edema that had appeared a few days earlier. He was in good general condition and afebrile. The initial blood tests showed a complete absence of neutrophils. Several blood test results were abnormal but expected for a patient undergoing hemodialysis: creatinine of 584 µmol/L (normal range = 80-115), urea of 10.1 mmol/L (normal range = 2.5-7.0), albumin of 31 g/L (normal range = 38-48), phosphorus of 1.4 mmol/L (normal range = 0.8-1.2), and magnesium of 1.14 mmol/L (normal range = 0.70-1.00). Liver function tests (bilirubin, transaminases) were normal and remained so throughout the hospitalization. At that time, the patient weighed 58.8 kg and had a height of 172 cm, resulting in a body surface area of 1.67 m2. At home, the patient was receiving treatment with alfacalcidol, amlodipine, calcium, cyclosporine (being tapered off), darbepoetin, famciclovir, and inhaled pentamidine once a month. Given the profound neutropenia suggestive of rejection and probable infection, the patient was hospitalized. Empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment was initiated. Severe gingival hypertrophy was observed, and a diagnosis of submandibular cellulitis was made. At this time, a bone marrow puncture revealed a low cellularity marrow with 86% donor chimerism in the blood.

Ten days after admission, neutropenia persisted and remained unexplained. The gingival hypertrophy, initially attributed to cyclosporine, worsened, and the cellulitic swelling of the face tended to harden. Faced with this uncontrolled infection and the onset of fever, the patient underwent another bone marrow puncture and biopsy, as well as a gingival biopsy. The bone marrow puncture and biopsy confirmed the rejection of the bone marrow graft due to 0% donor chimerism in the marrow. The gingival biopsy and microbiological samples taken from the tongue revealed rare fungal elements consistent with Candida albicans.

On day 12, the patient's condition deteriorated with the appearance of the following symptoms: a fever of 40 °C, respiratory distress requiring oxygen support (oxygen saturation at 84% in ambient air), and the development of bilateral crepitations on lung auscultation. Radiographic imaging showed increased opacity at the right base suggestive of a fungal infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage, performed on day 13, revealed the presence of yeast consistent with Candida albicans. Antifungal therapy was initiated on day 12 with caspofungin (an initial dose of 70 mg followed by 50 mg every 24 hours) in combination with two doses of intravenous voriconazole at 360 mg (3 mg/kg/dose) every 12 hours, followed by 250 mg (2.1 mg/kg/dose) intravenously every 12 hours. The first three doses were given at 12-hour intervals, but the fourth dose was administered 24 hours after the third dose. This delay was due to the patient being admitted to the intensive care unit for a brief period (less than 24 hours) due to septic-like hemodynamic instability. The treatments, investigations, and hemodialysis caused the delay in administering the fourth dose. In the evening of day 14, after the fourth dose of voriconazole, visual hallucinations occurred. The patient saw objects that he described as "mascots," and upon waking up, his vision was impaired by the presence of "snowflakes." A change in behavior was also noted. A cerebral and sinus computed tomography, which was normal, was performed in light of this neurological presentation. Without evidence supporting an Aspergillus infection and due to suspected voriconazole toxicity, the medication was discontinued after four doses. It was only 48 hours after the last dose that the visual disturbances and hallucinations completely disappeared without any lasting sequelae.

Voriconazole concentrations measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (with a diode array detector) showed a peak plasma concentration of approximately 9.4 µg/mL about 12 hours after the last dose. Figure 1 shows the evolution of plasma voriconazole concentrations. For scientific interest, voriconazole measurement in the dialysate was also performed. The voriconazole concentration in the dialysate was 0.5 µg/mL during the first dialysis session and 0.2 µg/mL during the second session.

Considering the adverse effects observed and the particularly high plasma voriconazole levels, genotyping of CYP2C19 by allele-specific hybridization for the CYP2C19*2 (681G>A) mutation was performed by the pharmacogenomics research laboratory at CHU Sainte-Justine. The results revealed a polymorphism (681G>A) on one of the two alleles of the CYP2C19 gene, indicating that the patient had heterozygous slow metabolizer status.

The patient was discharged from the hospital 46 days after admission. He had to continue intravenous anti-infective treatment with caspofungin and vancomycin at home. A second unrelated cord blood allogeneic transplantation was performed approximately 16 months after the first one due to graft rejection. Four years after the second allogeneic transplantation, the patient was in good general condition, although he still underwent dialysis three times a week.
