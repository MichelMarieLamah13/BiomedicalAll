Mr. S.A..., a 50-year-old patient with diabetes for 10 years, was admitted in August 1998 for a febrile swelling on the right lumbar region accompanied by chills. Examination revealed redness, swelling, and crepitation on the flank and the right thoracic wall.

Fasting blood glucose level was 1.71 g/L. Serum urea was 0.51 g/L, and creatinine was 9.2 mg/L. Hemoglobin was 9.5 g/L, and hematocrit was 29.4%. Cytobacteriological examination of the urine revealed the presence of Acinetobacter.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed gas in the posterior abdominal wall, right perinephric space, and the right kidney (Figure 1). It also revealed right pyelocaliceal dilation due to a stone obstructing the right pyeloureteral junction (Figure 2). Chest X-ray showed the presence of gas in the thoracic wall. The diagnosis of emphysematous pyelonephritis was established in this diabetic patient.

The patient was immediately started on regular insulin and a combination of antibiotics (ceftazidime, gentamicin, and metronidazole). A lumbotomy was performed at the 11th intercostal space, which resulted in the drainage of 2 liters of pus and debridement of perirenal pus pockets. Thorough irrigation was performed. Extensive changes necessitated initial drainage only, with plans for subsequent cold nephrectomy. The wound was closed with Delbet's sutures, and incisions for drainage were made in the thoracic wall. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the Delbet's sutures were removed on the 9th postoperative day. Intravenous urography was performed on the 21st postoperative day, revealing a non-functioning right kidney due to an obstructive stone in the pyeloureteral junction. At the 2-month mark, a right nephrectomy was performed through the previous incision under optimal conditions. The patient recovered well with normal renal function. The left kidney appeared normal on ultrasound examination. The patient's diabetes was well controlled.
