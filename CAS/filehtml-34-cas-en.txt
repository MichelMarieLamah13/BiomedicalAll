A 32-year-old Caucasian female patient weighing 68 kg, with no known drug allergies or relevant medical history except for allergic asthma, was admitted to the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation unit. Four months prior to this admission, the patient complained of fatigue and bruising. Hematological tests confirmed a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Complete remission was achieved after induction therapy consisting of four cycles of hyperCVAD chemotherapy (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone). Cytogenetic analysis revealed the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome but the presence of MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene rearrangement, indicating a high risk of leukemia relapse. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor was recommended as the patient did not have a compatible sibling donor. The conditioning regimen used was high-dose cyclophosphamide combined with total body irradiation. Upon admission for transplantation, the patient's renal function (creatinine: 62 μmol/L), liver function (total bilirubin: 5 μmol/L; alanine aminotransferase: 5 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase: 13 U/L), and hematological parameters (white blood cells: 4.1 × 109/L; neutrophils: 2.4 × 109/L; platelets: 236 × 109/L; hemoglobin: 122 g/L) were within normal ranges.

Five days after graft transplantation, the patient experienced a fever episode with a temperature of 38.2 °C accompanied by headaches and rhinorrhea with purulent discharge, despite not being neutropenic. Intravenous treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every six hours) was initiated due to suspected acute sinusitis. To begin this broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient discontinued her prophylactic ciprofloxacin treatment for bacterial infections during the post-transplant neutropenic period. Sinusitis symptoms worsened over the next two days, and a facial CT scan revealed nearly complete opacification of the ethmoid sinuses. The radiologist diagnosed acute sinusitis on a chronic focus. The following day, on the eighth day after transplantation, the patient experienced recurrent fever with a temperature of 38 °C and became neutropenic (white blood cells: 0.1 × 109/L; neutrophils: 0 × 109/L). The dose of piperacillin-tazobactam was increased to 4.5 g intravenously every six hours, in accordance with the guidelines for the treatment of febrile neutropenia. Intravenous vancomycin was empirically added (1 g in 290 ml of infusion solution over one hour, every eight hours, at a dose of approximately 15 mg/kg/dose) to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum. At the initiation of vancomycin administration, the patient had a creatinine level of 46 μmol/L and showed no signs of neurological toxicity related to the previous chemotherapy. It was the patient's first exposure to vancomycin.

During the first vancomycin infusion, the patient developed flushing and itching. Despite slowing down the infusion rate and administering premedication, these symptoms persisted and were accompanied by tremors and numbness in the extremities. Table I describes the vancomycin dose, infusion rate, premedication, and the patient's reactions during each infusion. No hypotension was reported during vancomycin treatment.

On the ninth day, a vancomycin level test conducted before the administration of the third dose revealed a serum concentration of 7.6 mg/L. The vancomycin dose was increased to 1.25 g in 293 ml of solution every eight hours. Vancomycin was discontinued the following day due to the patient's intolerance, after the administration of four complete doses and one incomplete dose. The patient's symptoms in response to vancomycin infusion resolved between infusions. On the tenth day, 12 hours after the last reaction, no signs or symptoms of a reaction were observed, and they did not reappear during hospitalization.

Daptomycin was used as a replacement for vancomycin until cultures ruled out the presence of resistant bacteria and the patient's condition improved (hematological recovery, absence of fever, and resolution of sinusitis symptoms). Table II presents the concomitant medications received by the patient during the post-transplant period.
