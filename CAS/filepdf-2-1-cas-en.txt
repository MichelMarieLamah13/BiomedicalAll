A 53-year-old female patient who underwent anterior resection with low colorectal anastomosis and neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer was admitted to urology due to obstructive renal failure with a creatinine level of 140 mmol/L and dilation of the pyelocaliceal cavities on ultrasound. Abdominopelvic CT scan did not reveal tumor recurrence, and tumor markers were within normal range. Retrograde ureteropyelography showed tight, regular, and filiform stenosis in both ureters. A double-J stent was placed in each ureter. Two days later, the patient experienced increased lower back pain, worsening renal failure with a creatinine level of 300 Âµmol/L, and increased dilation of the pyelocaliceal cavities on ultrasound. The proper positioning of the double-J stents was confirmed by abdominal plain film X-ray. Despite the placement of 2 new double-J stents, renal function continued to deteriorate, accompanied by further dilation of the pyelocaliceal cavities.

The double-J stents were replaced once again, this time with 7 French single ureteral catheters, which resulted in normalization of creatinine levels and regression of dilation within a week. A tailed double-J stent with a diameter of 7 French, length of 22-33 cm, was placed in each ureter.

Regular follow-up examinations of serum creatinine levels and pyelocaliceal cavities on ultrasound showed satisfactory results at six months of follow-up.
