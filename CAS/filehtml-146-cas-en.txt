The anesthesiologist performed a spinal anesthesia for hysteroscopy and myomectomy on a 40-year-old epileptic patient.

The procedure was carried out with the assistance of a familiar nurse anesthetist from the facility.

According to the applicable protocol, after needle insertion, one-tenth of the content of a 1mg morphine ampoule, equivalent to 0.1mg, was to be injected.

The nurse anesthetist prepared the morphine syringe and handed it to the anesthesiologist, who administered the injection.

While checking the empty ampoules after the anesthesia, the nurse anesthetist realized that she had used a 10mg morphine ampoule instead of a 1mg ampoule.

Consequently, the patient received a dose ten times higher than necessary (10mg instead of 0.1mg).

The nurse had mistakenly selected the wrong ampoule due to unclear storage in the toxic cabinet.

Enhanced monitoring of the patient was implemented, initially in the post-interventional care unit (PICU), and later in the intensive care unit (ICU), where she spent the night without the need to initiate the NALOXONE protocol.

There were no adverse effects for the patient, except for mild drowsiness.
