This is a 41-year-old premenopausal woman who presented to the emergency department (day 1) with chest pain and epigastric pain radiating to the right scapula that had been occurring for approximately two weeks. The patient's medical history and medication are presented in Table I. Her medication has been stable for a long time and well tolerated. Clopidogrel was added upon admission. The specialist replaced the patient's rabeprazole with pantoprazole because he considered the latter more effective and to avoid potential interaction with the addition of clopidogrel.

The patient does not smoke, follows a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, but engages in little exercise due to her condition. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/80 mm Hg, and her pulse is regular at 68 beats per minute. The chest X-ray is normal. Upon arrival, the laboratory data are as follows: hemoglobin of 119 g/L (usual range: 140 to 180), LDL at 1.37 mmol/L (<2), HDL at 2.3 mmol/L, triglycerides at 0.7 mmol/L (<1.7), apolipoprotein B at 0.42 g/L (<0.8), creatine kinase (CK) at 49 U/L (0 to 195), troponin T at 22 ng/L (<0.50), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 0.28 mg/L (<2), and sedimentation rate at 2 mm/h (0-20). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, amylase, lipase, and urinalysis are also normal.

Over the past ten years, she has undergone four coronary angiographies, nine echocardiograms, and twelve treadmill stress tests. Since the last dilation procedure four years ago, no significant lesions or evidence of restenosis have been observed on the coronary angiograms. Pulmonary pressures are normal, and no valvular disease is apparent on the echocardiograms. Electrophysiological parameters related to her implantable cardioverter-defibrillator follow-ups are adequate, with no significant anomalies and no therapy applied. Although this woman is not followed at this institution, she assures us that her lupus is stable. Furthermore, her C-reactive protein is normal, blood pressure is well controlled, and the anginal pain does not have a pericardial character. Finally, she has no known psychiatric history. However, the patient continues to experience chest pain.

These pains remind her of her previous myocardial infarction and have been almost absent for the past four years. They are constrictive in nature, last a maximum of thirty minutes, and are sometimes partially or completely relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. As a result, she has significantly increased her nitroglycerin consumption. The chest pain occurs both during exertion and at rest, and sometimes after strong emotions. They can occur more than ten times a day and are very bothersome. The pains do not occur at night or early in the morning. They cause fatigue and dyspnea. No discomfort occurs during positional changes.

On day 1, an exercise stress test is performed, and chest pain occurs after 3.15 minutes. The test is therefore clinically positive, and no electrical changes were noted.

On day 2, a coronary angiography is performed, revealing no significant lesions, and the pulmonary pressure remains normal. An ergonovine test yields negative results. Clopidogrel is discontinued.

Since the patient is partially relieved by nitroglycerin, she is referred for a gastroenterology consultation. Gastroscopy, abdominal ultrasound, and esophageal manometry performed by the gastroenterologist yield normal results. pH monitoring is positive. The dose of pantoprazole is increased to twice daily, and three doses of 10 mg domperidone per day are added.

Since her admission and in the following days, the patient experiences frequent chest pains that are rarely relieved by nitroglycerin. The treating physician attempts to optimize anti-anginal therapy. However, the patient cannot tolerate higher doses of amlodipine and bisoprolol.

The treating physician decides to try administering nicorandil at a dose of 10 mg twice daily. This product is not marketed in Canada, but it can be used by making a request to Health Canada's Special Access Program. The request has been submitted, and the patient has been discharged. At the time of writing this article, the follow-up appointment has not yet taken place.
