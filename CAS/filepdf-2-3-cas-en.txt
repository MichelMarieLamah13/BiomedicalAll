A 78-year-old patient, previously diagnosed with prostate cancer and nodal metastases, who had already undergone endoscopic prostatic resection with pulpectomy, was urgently admitted due to acute obstructive renal failure with a creatinine level of 330 mmol/L, accompanied by fever and bilateral ureterohydronephrosis on ultrasound. The pelvic ureteral compression was secondary to extensive iliac lymph node involvement, as observed on the abdominal-pelvic CT scan. Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was performed as an emergency procedure, which normalized renal function and temperature within three days. An attempted placement of standard double-J stents was unsuccessful due to the tightness of the stenosis. Therefore, JJ stents with tails were inserted through the nephrostomy tracts.

However, as renal function worsened again after three weeks, the standard JJ stents were replaced with tailed JJ stents, resulting in normalization of creatinine levels and maintaining it at 100 mmol/L during a 3-month follow-up period.
