This is the case of a 20-year-old patient weighing 68 kg, with no known drug allergies, who was admitted to the intensive care unit for refractory status epilepticus despite three doses of subcutaneous lorazepam at 1 mg each. The patient has a history of various neurological disorders related to encephalitis that she experienced six years ago, which caused cerebral atrophy, dysphagia, and epilepsy.

Her regular medications (all administered via jejunostomy) were continued, and enteral feeding through jejunostomy was also maintained. The medications she was taking upon hospital admission were prescribed during a previous hospitalization for status epilepticus eight months prior to the current episode. They include: 175 mg of phenytoin suspension (25 mg/mL) once daily, 1500 mg of levetiracetam twice daily, clobazam 30 mg in the morning and 40 mg at bedtime, and 50 mg of amantadine twice daily. The patient also receives 40 mg of esomeprazole once daily, 400 units of vitamin D, and 250 mg of calcium. Since her last hospital discharge, the patient has not experienced any seizures despite a gradual reduction in her phenytoin dose from 300 mg to 175 mg once daily. At home, her medications are administered by the nursing staff at the long-term care hospital where she resides. It should be noted that enteral feeding was continued throughout her hospitalization, and the timing of enteral feeding and phenytoin administration via jejunostomy has always been adhered to.

Upon arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient received an intravenous infusion of propofol at a rate of 2.2 mg/kg/h. The day after admission, a serum phenytoin level test was ordered. The blood sample taken before the dose showed an uncorrected phenytoin level of 27 μmol/L, while the level corrected for albumin (31 g/L) using the Winter-Tozer formula was 38 μmol/L. Since the target phenytoin level range was between 60 and 80 μmol/L, the patient received a partial loading dose of phenytoin via jejunostomy of 650 mg (9.6 mg/kg), and the daily dose was increased to 250 mg via jejunostomy once daily.

On day three, with the corrected serum phenytoin level at 56 μmol/L (uncorrected: 38 μmol/L; albumin: 29 g/L), the seizures resumed. The propofol dose was then increased to 4.4 mg/kg/h via intravenous route. However, the patient developed hypotension (blood pressure of 70/40 mm Hg), necessitating the addition of intravenous norepinephrine. On day five, despite the increased propofol dose, the patient experienced further seizures. A continuous infusion of pentobarbital was initiated at a rate of 3 mg/kg/h via intravenous route. The propofol dose was reduced to 2.2 mg/kg/h via intravenous route. On the seventh day of hospitalization, the patient had a corrected serum phenytoin level of 60 μmol/L (uncorrected: 41 μmol/L; albumin: 29 g/L), and had not experienced any seizures since the addition of pentobarbital. Since the phenytoin levels were increasing slowly despite the increased maintenance dose of 250 mg via jejunostomy once daily, the treating team decided to administer 250 mg of phenytoin via intravenous route once daily. On the ninth day, with the patient appearing stable, propofol was discontinued. On the 10th day, the corrected serum phenytoin level was 57 μmol/L (uncorrected: 38 μmol/L; albumin: 28 g/L), and pentobarbital was also discontinued. The phenytoin dose was increased to 350 mg via intravenous route once daily.

On the 12th day, the patient exhibited clinical signs of infection. A prescription was given for 3.375 g of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam every six hours. On the 14th day, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia was diagnosed. The dose of piperacillin-tazobactam was increased to 4.5 g via intravenous route every six hours, and 400 mg of intravenous ciprofloxacin was added every 12 hours. However, on the 16th day, the corrected serum phenytoin level dropped to 12 μmol/L (uncorrected: 9 μmol/L; albumin: 33 g/L). Therefore, the phenytoin dose was increased to 150 mg via intravenous route three times daily, along with a loading dose of 750 mg (11 mg/kg) via intravenous route. Despite the dose increases, the phenytoin serum levels did not rise as expected. Thus, on the 20th day, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam were replaced with imipenem. Following this substitution, the phenytoin dose was reduced to 125 mg via intravenous route three times daily. Two days later, the corrected serum phenytoin level was 37 μmol/L (uncorrected: 27 μmol/L; albumin: 32 g/L), after which the patient received a loading dose of 600 mg of phenytoin (8.8 mg/kg) via intravenous route. The treating team then decided to add 250 mg of valproic acid via jejunostomy three times daily. During the following weeks, the treating team had to manage the interaction between valproic acid and phenytoin. Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was receiving 300 mg of phenytoin via jejunostomy once daily, 250 mg of valproic acid via jejunostomy three times daily, 1500 mg of levetiracetam twice daily, and clobazam 30 mg in the morning and 40 mg at bedtime.
